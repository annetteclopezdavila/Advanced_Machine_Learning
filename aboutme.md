Welcome! My name is Annette Lopez Davila and I am a recent graduate from William and Mary. I am an Applied Mathematics and Data Science major. I've taken numerous courses in Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Analysis covering topics such as Computer Vision, Regression Analysis, Optimization, NLPs, Neural Networks, and Operations Research. Currently, I am looking for a job in which I can grow these skills. In the meantime, I am working on several personal projects, learning more languages such as SQL, and looking for certifications in the field. When I'm not studying, I spend my free time hiking, fishing, doing photography, playing and teaching tennis, and cooking!
