## Headings
Hello
Use hashtags for heading size; the more hashtags, the more headings.

*Examples*
- One Hashtag:
# Hi
- Two Hashtags:
## Hi
- Three Hashtags: 
### Hi

## Italicize and Bold
Use two star symbols for italicized material- one before and one after the word/phrase. 

*Hello*

In order to bolden words, place three star symbols before and after the word/phrase.

***Hi***

## Code Blocks
In order to put blocks of code, place words in backticks

`import numpy`

To make a whole code chunk, add three squiggles above and below the code:
~~~
import numpy as np
import math
~~~
In order to highlight syntax/change coding language, place three backticks followed by coding language.
```python
import numpy as np
```

## Tables
In order to make tables:
~~~
| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |
~~~
It is rendered as:


| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |



## Images
To add image, place exclamation point followed by bracketed word followed by URL in parenthesis

## Links
Links are added the same way images are without the exclamation point. Find more information for markdown and HTML at [this website](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
